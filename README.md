# Project1-Andy---Cheonan

To collect data using the microbit, the RawDataCollection file should be ran on mu-editor. 
The data collected by our microbit is stored in the pendulum.txt file. This is the file that the parsing code will read. 
The PendulumSimulation file contains the simulation of the pendulum, as well as code to plot the simulated relationship between length of pendulum and period. 
Finally, our Project 1 report is also found here.
